SUTRA's dual-transformer architecture is specifically designed to excel at multilingual tasks, making it an ideal choice for global applications requiring language understanding and generation across diverse linguistic contexts.

## Contents

This folder is intended for future multilingual examples and resources. Currently, multilingual examples can be found in other sections of the repository:

Additionally, there is a markdown version of the notebook available in the main repository:

- [Using Regional Languages with SUTRA (Markdown)](../../Using_Regional_Languages_with_Sutra.md) - Contains the same content as the notebook but in markdown format with a Colab link for easy access.
